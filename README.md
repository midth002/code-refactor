# Code Refactor: Horiseon

## Description

**Refactored** Refactored the existing code for this website to improve and implement new technologies in HTML and CSS. Updated the un-semantic tags to become semantic tags to make it more accessible and easier to understand the source code. 

**Quick bug fix** Needed to fix one of the links in the HTML list on the nav bar so users can select the link and take them to the correct article.

**Notes/Comments** Added comments and notes to both html and css files on what was changed, what the particular code is doing and where everything is structured on the page. Also, commented out the old code just for referencing what was there before originally in the source code.
